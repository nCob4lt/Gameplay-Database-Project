File: maincog.py

This module defines the `MainCog` class â€” the core cog responsible for managing
the lifecycle, background tasks, and maintenance operations of the Gameplay Database bot.

It performs the following key roles:
    - Handles the bot's startup routine (`on_ready`)
    - Manages periodic tasks for data synchronization and auto-saving
    - Provides a command to manually load database backups

All activity and errors are logged through the `AppLogger` utility for easier debugging
and maintenance.

        Loads a database backup file from the local save directory.

        This command allows moderators to manually restore the database
        from a previously saved backup file. It ensures that only authorized
        users can perform the operation, preventing unauthorized data restoration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        interaction : discord.Interaction
            The Discord interaction context where the command is executed.
        filename : str
            The exact name of the backup file to load from the save folder.

        Behavior
        --------
        - Verifies that the user has moderator permissions using `tools.check_mod()`.
        - Logs the command usage via `AppLogger.debug_command()`.
        - Calls `recovery.load_save()` to restore database content from the given file.

        Notes
        -----
        - Only available to moderators.
        - Loading a backup will overwrite the current database contents.
        - Ensure the specified file exists in the save folder before execution.
        - Recommended to back up current data before restoring an older version.
